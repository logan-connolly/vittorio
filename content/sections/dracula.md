Born in 1959, he is a mystical creature that is often heard before he’s seen. Equipped with a boisterous laughter and a big belly, any man to cross paths with a Vittorio can only count himself – or herself – lucky.

The Vittorio can be territorial, and may get aggressive when approached with certain conversational topics. Indications of aggressive behaviour includes speaking with a louder voice, slow shakes of the head and, in a rare case of extreme aggression, condescending laughter. When confronted with an aggressive Vittorio, adopt an apologetic stance. Using words like “buddy”, “big baby” and “habalahabala” might further help defuse the situation.

Despite the (alleged) thick Dutch accent, the Vittorio holds Italy dear to his heart and, when prompted about Ravenna, the Vittorio will vividly describe its multiple UNESCO heritage sites with great pride. But be warned: once he starts, he cannot be stopped.

He has few known weaknesses – unless you count his volatile tear ducts, guitar obsession and fragile knee – but experts have identified one: his registered mate4lyfe, JoJo. And possibly his overconsumption of cheese.
