Born in 1959, he is a mystical creature that is often heard before heâ€™s seen. Equipped with a boisterous laughter and a big belly, any man to cross paths with a Vittorio can only count himself - or herself - lucky. Vittorios may often speak with a Dutch accent, but do not be fooled as Italy lies deep within his heart. When prompted about Ravenna, he will rave(nna) on about its multiple UNESCO heritage sites with great pride. 
But be warned: once he starts, he cannot be stopped. He has very few weaknesses - unless you count his big heart, sensitive emotions and fragile knee - but for one: Joanne. Her roar is fierce, and Vittorio, when smart, cowers.
